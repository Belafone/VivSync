# VivSync
VivSync: Automatic synchronization tool for Vivendi work schedules with calendar apps. Extracts schedules directly from the Vivendi portal, offering both local iCal export and continuous online sync through subscribable calendar links. Created as an alternative to the deactivated calendar feature in Vivendi PEP.
